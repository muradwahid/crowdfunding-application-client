          Unlike text-to-give, there are no minimum requirements for
          text-to-donate. This way, organizations of all sizes and missions can
          use the text fundraising effort. Text-to-donate also allows supporters
          to make custom donation amounts, set up recurring donations, and
          offset processing fees.
